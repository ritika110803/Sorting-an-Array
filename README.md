# Bubble Sort in C

This is a simple implementation of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm in the C programming language. Bubble Sort is a straightforward sorting technique that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the array is sorted.

## Features

- Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
- Easy-to-understand and beginner-friendly implementation.
- Prints the sorted array after completion.

## Example

Given the array:
[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]

After sorting with Bubble Sort, the output will be:
Sorted array: 1 2 5 5 6 9
